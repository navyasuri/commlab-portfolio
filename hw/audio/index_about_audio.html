<p class="des">The idea behind</p>
 
 <p class="descr1">The idea behind this audio is to take you on an emotionally adventurous journey that would tickle your nerves. Imagine you had another tiring working day, and now you just want to get back home and relax. But what if your peace was distracted by a creepy noise coming out of nowhere closer and closer to you? </p>
  <p class="descr2">The audio work was prepared by Elza Legran and Navya Suri, sophomore students at New York University Abu Dhabi. For questions and concerns please send us an email to elzalehran@gmail.com </p>

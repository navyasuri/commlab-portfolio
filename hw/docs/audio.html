    <h1>Documentation: Four</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
    <p>For the Audio Project, Elza and I created a sound piece that we named &ldquo;Four&rdquo;. Our project is mini
        horror story, where a man who comes home is mysteriously overcome by an entity in his house. The objective of
        the piece is to get you a teeny bit scared, and to give you the &ldquo;AHA&rdquo; moment when you realise what
        is actually happening. </p>

    <p>The story that we came up with was an extrapolation of a story that I&rsquo;d heard before. We&rsquo;ve altered
        the details and the setting, but our sound piece essentially draws from this one story that a friend had told
        me a long time ago. We first listed out the various things that would be necessary to create this piece. We
        made a document of the individual elements that we&rsquo;d include and then brainstormed over where we could
        source the different audios. After getting the green signal on the project idea, we split up the tasks. I dived
        into the web to collect different sounds and Elza took care of recording a friend&rsquo;s voice for the
        protagonist and her roommate's voice for the mysterious entity.</p>

    <p>We then had the task of putting things together to create the final audio as well as creating a website for it
        to live on. In our discussion, we realised that I had more experience doing Web Design and Elza had more
        experience working with Video/Audio. If I did the website and she did the audio, then neither of us would learn
        as much as we could if we did it the other way. So I worked on compiling the audio, and Elza was responsible
        for the website. I used audacity to create the entire sound piece. The various effects that it lets you play
        with took a while to understand but I was able to use the ones I needed to create what I wanted. We worked
        together so that we could help each other when needed and also get feedback at different points.</p>

    <p>A particular point that I want to emphasize in my documentation is the title of the project and how we went
        about choosing it. Initially, Elza had put &ldquo;The doll story&rdquo; as the title as a placeholder. We
        discussed then of how we should choose a title. I advocated for a very vague title from the very beginning. We
        went over some titles such as &ldquo;night&rdquo;, &ldquo;room&rdquo;, etc., but none of them were hitting the
        mark. I then suggested the title &ldquo;Three&rdquo;, and when we almost decided to keep that, we changed our
        minds to keep the title &ldquo;four&rdquo; instead. I wanted users to read the title and then be perplexed
        about what it means. While they listen to the audio, most don&rsquo;t realise that three turns into four after
        the man is overcome. When they do hear the mysterious entity chanting four, it hits them to enhance the
        &ldquo;AHA&rdquo; moment that I was going for. I&rsquo;m not sure to what extent this worked out - it is
        something I will only find out with more feedback.</p>

    <p>I am happy with the audio we created. I do realise that there could be a lot of places where certain things
        could be done to make it &ldquo;smoother&rdquo; - but I neither possessed the technical knowledge nor the time
        to make these things happen. When I asked a couple of friends to hear the audio, most of them gave a positive
        response. They were all able to identify the plot and the feel I was going for and most even reported being
        &ldquo;freaked out&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a big positive to me. In terms of the website, I find it really well
        designed. Elza did a wonderful job at the animation of the title which glows in pulses. The overall layout is
        also something that I really like - it contains only the things that we need it to, and no extra fluff. </p>

    <p>It was a great experience compiling this sound piece. I&rsquo;ve pushed myself and learned a lot of new stuff
        about audio editing and how it works. </p>

        <p>Our video was a meta film, ie, it was a film about making a film. I found this concept sort-of confusing and
            a bit funny at the same time. That&rsquo;s the sort of overall theme I was going for. The two main themes I
            was trying to incorporate were &ldquo;humor&rdquo; and &ldquo;confusion&rdquo;. I wanted primarily to
            create a simple, minimalistic website without much flash and dash - something that&rsquo;s easy on the eye
            and is comfortable to use. I didn&rsquo;t want it to be a conventional website either - with the normal
            &lsquo;banner&rsquo; and &lsquo;navbar&rsquo;. </p>

        <p>The confusion aspect comes with the part where you start off without any sort of navigation. The
            scrolljacking may confuse some people about why they aren&rsquo;t able to scroll for themselves. Next, the
            content in the website is full of question marks thrown around which are to reinforce the sort-of
            &ldquo;uhhh.. What?&rdquo; feeling. I didn&rsquo;t find a way to incorporate humor into the design, so I
            tried to incorporate it into the content instead. I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t laugh, but you can see
            that I&rsquo;ve at least tried to add some sarcasm and a few puns here and there (hunt for them). </p>

        <p>I spent hours fixing silly things like forgetting document.ready() in the jquery and implementing a coin
            flip with css. I have always maintained that debugging is a serious pain. One of my goals was to not spend
            as much time on this as I ended up doing - and I guess I was unable to meet that goal. Overall, I am
            satisfied with the final working version. If I had more time, I might have added some more transitions and
            a few more images here and there, maybe a horizontal scrolling section as well. However, those are just
            possible additions. I&rsquo;m quite happy with the current website and I hope you like it too!</p>
